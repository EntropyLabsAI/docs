# Main Components of the Asteroid Package

The Asteroid package provides tools to build robust AI applications with supervision and evaluation capabilities. By integrating projects, tasks, runs, supervision functions, the `@supervise` decorator, and custom supervisors, you can create AI systems that are controllable, testable, and can involve human oversight.

This section provides an overview of the main components of the Asteroid package, along with code examples to illustrate their usage.

## Projects, Tasks, and Runs

In the Asteroid framework, a **Project** is a container for tasks, which in turn contain runs. This hierarchy helps organize and track experiments and deployments.

- **Project**: A container for tasks; it could represent an AI application or service.
- **Task**: Represents a specific task or experiment within a project.
- **Run**: A single execution instance of a task, which can be monitored and supervised.

### Registering a Project, Task, and Run

To register a project, task, and run, you can use the `asteroid_init` function provided by the `asteroid-sdk` package.

Here's how you can register all three in one Python snippet:

```python
from asteroid_sdk.wrappers.openai import asteroid_openai_client, asteroid_init
# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# Important! For this to work, Asteroid server needs to be running, contact Asteroid to get access
run_id = asteroid_init(project_name="Project 1",
                       task_name="Task 1",
                       run_name="Run 1")

# When you wrap the client, all supervised functions will be registered
wrapped_client = asteroid_openai_client(client, run_id)

```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up the project structure in Asteroid, allowing you to track and manage your AI application's executions.

## The `@supervise` Decorator

The `@supervise` decorator is a powerful feature that adds supervision functionality to your functions or tools. It allows you to:

- **Enforce constraints and validations** during function execution.
- **Mock function responses** for testing and development.
- **Reuse previous execution logs** to simulate tool responses.

### Usage

You can use the `@supervise` decorator to wrap your functions and specify supervision functions, mock policies, and responses.

```python
from asteroid_sdk.supervision import supervise, MockPolicy

@supervise(
    supervision_functions=[supervisor_function],  # Replace with your supervisor functions
    mock_policy=MockPolicy.NO_MOCK,  # Choose an appropriate mock policy
    mock_responses=None  # Provide mock responses if needed
)
def my_function(args):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

### Example

Here's an example using the `@supervise` decorator to supervise a function:

```python
from asteroid_sdk.supervision import supervise, human_supervisor, llm_supervisor

# Define a policy or instructions for the LLM supervisor
EMAIL_POLICY = "Ensure that the email content is appropriate and follows company guidelines."

@supervise(
    supervision_functions=[
        [llm_supervisor(instructions=EMAIL_POLICY)],  # First supervision chain
        [human_supervisor()]  # Second supervision chain
    ]
)
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    """
    Send an email to the specified recipient.

    Parameters:
        to (str): Recipient's email address.
        subject (str): Subject of the email.
        body (str): Body content of the email.
    """
    # Implement the email sending logic
    pass
```

In this example, the `send_email` function is supervised by an LLM supervisor, which checks the email content according to the provided policy, and a human supervisor for final approval.

## Building Custom Supervisors Using the `ToolCallSupervisor` Protocol

You can create custom supervisors by implementing the `Supervisor` protocol. This allows you to define custom logic for approving, rejecting, modifying, or escalating function execution.

### The `ToolCallSupervisor` Protocol

The `Supervisor` protocol defines the expected signature for supervisor functions:

```python
from typing import Optional, Protocol
from uuid import UUID
from openai import OpenAI
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.config import SupervisionContext, SupervisionDecision
from asteroid_sdk.types import Tool, ChatCompletionMessageToolCall

class ToolCallSupervisor(Protocol):
    """Protocol for tool call supervisors."""
    
    def __call__(
        self,
        tool: Tool,
        tool_call: ChatCompletionMessageToolCall,
        supervision_context: SupervisionContext,
        ignored_attributes: list[str] = [],
        supervision_request_id: Optional[UUID] = None,
        previous_decision: Optional[SupervisionDecision] = None,
        **kwargs
    ) -> SupervisionDecision:
        """Makes a decision based on the tool call and supervision context."""
        ...
```

### Creating a Custom Supervisor

Here's an example of creating a custom supervisor that checks if an email address is in a whitelist:

```python
from typing import List
from asteroid_sdk.types import Tool, ChatCompletionMessageToolCall
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.config import SupervisionDecision, SupervisionDecisionType, SupervisionContext
import json

def check_email_address_supervisor(whitelisted_emails: List[str]) -> ToolCallSupervisor:
    def supervisor(
        tool: Tool,
        tool_call: ChatCompletionMessageToolCall,
        supervision_context: SupervisionContext,
        ignored_attributes: list[str] = [],
        supervision_request_id: Optional[UUID] = None,
        previous_decision: Optional[SupervisionDecision] = None,
        **kwargs
    ) -> SupervisionDecision:
        # Parse the tool call arguments
        args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
        to_email = args.get('to')
        
        if to_email in whitelisted_emails:
            return SupervisionDecision(
                decision=SupervisionDecisionType.APPROVE,
                explanation=f"The email address '{to_email}' is allowed."
            )
        else:
            return SupervisionDecision(
                decision=SupervisionDecisionType.ESCALATE,
                explanation=f"The email address '{to_email}' is not in the whitelist."
            )
            
    supervisor.__name__ = check_email_address_supervisor.__name__
    supervisor.supervisor_attributes = {"whitelisted_emails": whitelisted_emails}
    return supervisor
```

You can then use this custom supervisor in the `@supervise` decorator:

```python
@supervise(
    supervision_functions=[
        [check_email_address_supervisor(whitelisted_emails=['allowed@example.com'])]
    ]
)
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

## Human-in-the-Loop Using `human_supervisor`

To involve human oversight in your application's decision-making process, you can use the `human_supervisor`. This supervisor escalates decisions to a human reviewer.

### Using `human_supervisor`

Here's how you can use the `human_supervisor` in your `@supervise` decorator:

```python
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.supervisors import human_supervisor

@supervise(
    supervision_functions=[
        [human_supervisor(timeout=300)]  # Waits up to 300 seconds for human decision
    ]
)
def sensitive_action(data):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

When the `sensitive_action` function is called, it will pause execution until a human reviewer approves or rejects the action via the Asteroid supervision interface.

## Conclusion

By leveraging projects, tasks, runs, the `@supervise` decorator, custom supervisors, and human-in-the-loop supervision, you can build AI applications that are robust, secure, and compliant with organizational policies.

The Asteroid package provides the tools you need to add supervision and evaluation capabilities to your AI systems, facilitating better control and testing.
