Sentinel is an agent control plane built by [Entropy Labs](http://entropy-labs.ai/) that allows you to efficiently supervise and evaluate agentic systems.

## How does it work? 

Sentinel has an API that agents can call to submit actions for approval. The request is routed via a predefined list of **supervisors**. When presented when with an action, a supervisor can:

- `approve` The action is safe and the agent can proceed.
- `reject` The action is unsafe and should not be executed, but the agent can continue.
- `modify` The action has been approved with modifications.
- `escalate` The action should be escalated to the next supervisor.
- `terminate` The agents execution should be terminated.

Finally, after the supervisors have made their decisions, the agent receives a response indicating the outcome of the approval process, which is either `approve`, `reject`, `modify`, or `terminate`. It is up to the agent's source code to handle these responses appropriately.

## Supervisors


Sentinel currently provides two types of supervisors for handling tool call suggestions: Human and LLM (Large Language Model).

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Human Supervisor" icon="user-check">
    <p>
      The Human Supervisor generates a specified number of tool call suggestions and sends them to an external API for human selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows manual review and decision-making by a human.</li>
        <li>Useful for scenarios requiring human judgment and oversight.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="LLM Supervisor" icon="robot">
    <p>
      The LLM Supervisor generates a specified number of tool call suggestions and sends them to an external API for selection by a Large Language Model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Automates decision-making using advanced language models.</li>
        <li>Ideal for high-volume or routine tasks where human intervention is not necessary.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </Card>

See the [API Reference](/api) to see how to call the API endpoints associated with each supervisor.

In the coming weeks we're planning to add support for more supervisors.

### Custom Supervisors
The vision for Sentinel is to allow for custom supervisors to be created and plugged in to the approval process. This will allow for a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to:
- Integrating with existing approval workflows
- Implementing specialized logic for certain types of actions

Currently, this is not yet supported, but if you have specific approvals processes you'd like to build please reach out.
