# Integrating Asteroid AI SDK with OpenAI

In this guide, we'll explore how to integrate the Asteroid AI SDK with the OpenAI SDK to build AI applications that are not only powerful but also supervised and controllable. Integration with Asteroid AI is possible with a few lines of code.


## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to use the Asteroid AI SDK with OpenAI, including how to create supervised tools, manage supervision contexts, and build assistant agents that interact with OpenAI's GPT models.

## Creating Supervised Tools

Supervised tools are functions wrapped with the `@supervise` decorator, allowing you to enforce policies, validations, and involve human supervisors when necessary.

### The `@supervise` Decorator

The `@supervise` decorator adds supervision capabilities to your functions. Place the supervisor decorator above the tool definition that you provide to OpenAI.

```python
from asteroid_ai.supervision import supervise

@supervise(supervision_functions=[...])
def your_function(params):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```
### Interacting with OpenAI Models

Use the OpenAI Chat Completion API to interact with the model. Example code:

```python
import openai
from typing import List, Dict, Any

def chat_with_openai(messages: List[Dict[str, Any]], functions: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages,
        functions=functions,
        function_call="auto",
    )
    return response
```

### Updating the Conversation Messages

For the supervisor to have access to the conversation history, you need to update the supervision context. Example code:

```python
from asteroid_ai.supervision.config import get_supervision_context
from uuid import UUID
from typing import List, Dict, Any

def update_messages(
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    new_message: Dict[str, Any],
    run_id: UUID
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    supervision_context = get_supervision_context(run_id)
    supervision_context.update_openai_messages(messages + [new_message])
    return messages + [new_message]
```

By updating the `SupervisionContext` with the latest messages, supervisors have access to the entire conversation history, allowing for informed decision-making.

## Example Application

Let's put everything together in an example where an assistant searches the internet, creates calendar events, and sends emails, all under supervision. Full example code is implemented in `examples/openai/run.ipynb` with more details in the [Quickstart guide example](/quickstart).


## Conclusion

Integrating the Asteroid AI SDK with OpenAI models allows you to build AI applications with robust supervision capabilities. By defining supervised tools and managing the supervision context, you can ensure that your AI assistant operates within defined policies and involves human oversight when necessary.

Key takeaways:

- Use the `@supervise` decorator to add supervision to your functions.
- Define supervisors to enforce policies or require human approval.
- Manage the `SupervisionContext` to maintain state and message history.
- Implement preprocessing functions to handle messages and tool arguments effectively.

By following this guide, you're well on your way to creating supervised, reliable, and controllable AI applications using Asteroid AI and OpenAI.
